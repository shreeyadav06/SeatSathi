## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Student provides their KCET rank, category, and course preferences via voice or text
2. **AI Processing**: Gemini AI processes the query and determines the appropriate action
3. **Tool Execution**: Backend tools (`find_matching_colleges`, `get_specific_college_cutoff`) query the cutoff database
4. **Smart Matching**: Algorithm matches student criteria against historical cutoff data
5. **Response Generation**: The agent generates personalized recommendations with probability scores
6. **Visual Display**: Results are displayed as interactive college cards
